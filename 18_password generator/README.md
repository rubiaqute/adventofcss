Password generator was made as one of the challenges in Advent of CSS 2022 (https://www.adventofcss.com/)

Deploy: https://rubiaqute-password-generator.netlify.app/

# Users should be able to:

- See a form input for displaying a generated password
- A copy button should appear to the right of the input field. When the user clicks on the copy button, the word “Copied” should appear.
- Range slider for selecting the number of characters. The number of characters should be displayed next to the slider.
- Checkboxes for the following
  - Include Symbols (@#$%)
  - Include Numbers (1234)
  - Include Lowercase Characters (abcd)
  - Include Uppercase Characters (ABCD)
  - Exclude Similar Characters (i, l, 1, L, o, O, 0)

Some features from me:

- Word “Copied” is animated and disapperes after 3 sec
- By default password can contain any character from checkboxes list
