Timer was made as one of the challenges in Advent of CSS 2022 (https://www.adventofcss.com/)

Deploy: https://rubiaqute-timer.netlify.app/

**Users should be able to:**

- Start the timer by clicking on the start link/button.
- Once the user clicks start, the word start will change to stop. Then, the user can click on the stop button to make the timer stop.
- Click on the gear icon to change the length (minutes and seconds) of the timer.
- Once the timer finishes, the ring should change from green to red and an alert message is passed to the browser.

Some features from me:
1) The ring not only changes the color, but also shows progress
2) Instead of alert there is a modal
3) The timer after it stops by user can be resumed.
