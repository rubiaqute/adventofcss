Youtube search page was made as one of the challenges in Advent of CSS 2022 (https://www.adventofcss.com/)

Deploy: https://rubiaqute-youtube-search.netlify.app/

# Users should be able to:

- See a Featured Video as a video embed from YouTube, with its corresponding title and description
- A sidebar with additional videos. These videos will show a thumbnail and corresponding title. Each thumbnail will link to that specific video on YouTube.
- The featured video and the sidebar of video thumbnails should scroll independently of each other.

Some features from me:

- Real data is fetched using Youtube api
- User can search videos using input field in the top of page
- Clicking on the snippet or main video leads to youtube page with this video
