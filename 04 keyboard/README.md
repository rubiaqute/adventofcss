Keyboard was made as one of the challenges in Advent of CSS 2022 (https://www.adventofcss.com/)

Deploy: https://rubiaqute-keyboard.netlify.app/

# **Users should be able to:**

- See the computer keyboard centered on the page
- A random letter will start to jiggle.
- The user should type the same key that's jiggling and it will stop.
- A new, random key will start jiggling

Some features from me:
1) You have the score. +1 point for every right press button, -1 point for the wrong one (if score > 0)
2) If you get 100 points - you win. Then you can start the game again
