                <p>Earlier, this week, this post came across my feed: “Framer is Dead.”</p>
                <p>Impossible. I’ve been using it non-stop for the past month.</p>
                <p>Sadly, this post has gotten some traction, and I’ve seen it pop-up on several round-ups. </p>
                <p>Two weeks ago, Framer launched a new home page design and Smart Components, with Variants coming out of Beta. Looking at new features alone, it’s very much alive and well. </p>
                <p>The leading case this post made was that Framer was at fault for moving toward React. In doing so, it’s alienating designers that aren’t code-savvy. Or, on the opposite end of the spectrum, over-empowering UX engineers who over-value the code. </p>
                <p>Then, as if to drive the nail in the coffin: “Framer used to be about playing around. Now it’s about building things.” — Frankly, I’m not sure why “playing around” and “building things” have to be mutually exclusive.</p>
                <p>Are we talking about the same product?</p>

            <div class="flex flex-col gap-8 leading-8 mb-8">
                <p>Before Framer, we were using <a href="http://invision.com" target="_blank" class="colored font-bold underline">Invision</a> for prototyping. At best, this experience felt clunky. I was taking static images, creating hot spots, and linking them together. If anything, it demonstrated how screens were linked together. But, during pitches, there was still a considerable amount of hand waving and, “Imagine this. The user will scroll down, and this will happen…”</p>
                <p> While this worked for some clients, others still had trouble making that leap, however big or small. There was even a fair amount of redesigning once developers got involved. “Oh, I didn’t realize that’s what you meant.</p>

                <p>In November (2020), I started working with a new client, designing a native application. About the same
                    time,
                    I
                    was listening to the <a href="https://designdetails.fm/episodes/h5VhO2W3"  class="colored font-bold underline" target="_blank">Design Details
                    Podcast, Episode 377: Future-Proof Designer</a>. One of the skills they talked about
                    was prototyping. <strong>The best designers at prototyping are the best communicators.</strong>
                </p>

            <blockquote class="blockquote text-2xl transparent-text">

            </blockquote>
            <div class="flex flex-col gap-8 leading-8 mb-8">
                <p>Noted.</p>
                <p>
                    At that moment, I knew that the most effective way to get stakeholders on board was to create a prototype true
                    to the
                    app's experience.
                </p>
                <p>That's the key: <strong>an app is an experience.</strong></p>

                <p>
                    When you're designing a native application, you're pushing pixels on a laptop or a desktop. The point is: it's a
                    different medium; it's a different device than how the end-user will experience the final product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wanted to create a prototype that felt real. They could pull it up on their mobile device and feel like they
                    were
                    using an application — no smoke and mirrors. No handwaving. No magic.

                    I've known about Framer for years but never explored it as an option. This project seemed like the perfect
                    opportunity
                    and the perfect fit.

            <p class="leading-8 mb-10">I recognize that my skill set is different. I design and write code. Not all designers code, and not all
                developers
                design — and that’s perfectly fine. I’ve found Framer blends both worlds in a way that I’ve never seen in an
                application.</p>

            <h3 class="font-black text-3xl mb-3" id="figma">Figma</h3>

            <p class="leading-8 mb-10">I’ve done all the initial design work within Figma. I have more experience there, and it’s allowed me to create
                multiple
                drafts and experiment in design without muddying my prototype in Framer.</p>

            <div class="outbox-container flex mb-10">
                <div>
                    <img class="image-step2" src="./images/figma-sidebar.png" alt="Figma Sidebar">
                </div>
                <div class="outbox-container gap-16 flex mb-10">
                <p>Once the design is cleaned up, I have a page in Figma that I use specifically for a hand-off. This keeps
                    unwanted
                    elements out of Framer</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3 class="font-black text-3xl mb-3" id="framerDesktop">Framer Desktop</h3>
            <div class="flex flex-col gap-8 leading-8 mb-10">
            <p>You can do everything within the browser, through Framer Web. In fact, Framer Web has more features than Framer
                Desktop.</p>
            <p>
                However, with Framer Desktop, I can directly access the code folder. Meaning, I can write custom ****React
                components
                within <strong>VS Code</strong>, my choice IDE.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also have access to the <strong>package.json</strong> file to install npm packages, like any other project.
                This only extends
                my
                toolset, giving me access to packages like <a href="https://styled-components.com/"  class="colored font-bold underline" target="_blank">Styled
                Components</a> and <a href="https://date-fns.org/" class="colored font-bold underline" target="_blank">date-fns</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                All code is committed to <strong>version control</strong>, either <a href="http://github.com/" class="colored font-bold underline"
                target="_blank">GitHub</a> or <a href="https://bitbucket.org/" class="colored font-bold underline" target="_blank">BitBucket</a>. This creates a
                better workflow for me, but
                also gives easy access to the engineers on the project.

            <h4 class="font-bold leading-8 mb-3">JSON Data Files</h4>
            <div class="flex flex-col gap-8 leading-8 mb-10">
                <p>I’ve created JSON files that outline the data. The state of the app and its design change based on the data
                    passed in.</p>

                <p>What does it look like to have 1 notification vs. 12? What happens when the user has overdue payments? What
                    does the app
                    look like when the user is in Phase 1 vs. Phase 3 of the program? Instead of creating prototypes for each use
                    case, I
                    update the data passed in.
                </p>

                <p>We can always change the shape of the data in my JSON file, but it does have the potential to mirror a
                    potential GraphQL
                    query.</p>
            </div>

            <h4 class="font-bold leading-8 mb-3">Sharing the Project</h4>
            <p class="leading-8 mb-10">Once I have a working prototype, I’ll upload the project to <strong>Framer Web</strong>. This makes it easy to
                generate share links. Even
                better, if someone has the <a href="#" target="_blank" class="colored font-bold underline">Framer Preview App</a> on their mobile device, I can
                generate a QR Code that allows them to
                interact with the prototype on their phone, just like the final native app.</p>

            <div class="flex flex-col gap-8 leading-8 mb-10">
                <p>As with most projects, this one has a tight developer schedule. One of the biggest perks that we’ve found is
                    that Framer
                    has gotten us to the end result faster. I’m able to hand over the React components I’ve created with minimal
                    refactoring.</p>
                <p>While this process might sound more like <em>building</em> instead of <em>experimenting</em>, I didn’t list in
                    detail all the “play” that
                    is woven throughout the entire process.</p>
