# **Users should be able to:**

- Display 10 entries of data preloaded into **app.js**
- Sort columns ascending or descending by ID, Name, Email Address, and Job Title
- Click on the edit button and the row will show the content in an inline form. Changes can be confirmed by clicking on the check button.
- Users can view the next page of data (if you’re not on the last page already) by clicking on the next arrow (bottom right).
- Users can view the previous page of data (if you’re not on the first page) by clicking on the previous arrow (bottom right).
- The user can jump to a specific page by changing the number in the pagination text field (bottom right). Data is updated as soon as the user clicks off the input (blur).
- The total number of results is displayed (bottom left).
