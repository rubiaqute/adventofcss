Weather app was made as one of the challenges in Advent of CSS 2022 (https://www.adventofcss.com/)

Deploy: https://rubiaqute-weather-app.netlify.app/

**Users should be able to:**

- Display the weather forecast.

Some features from me:

- Weather forecast is real and fetched from https://openweathermap.org/. So the quantity of cards was decreased to 5 due to the fact that forecast for free is only available no more than 5 days ahead
- User can input another city name and get real weather forecast for it.
