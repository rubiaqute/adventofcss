Menu cart was made as one of the challenges in Advent of CSS 2022 (https://www.adventofcss.com/)

Deploy: https://rubiaqute-ecomm.netlify.app/

**Users should be able to:**

- View the plates on the left side of the screen and add them to your cart on the right side.
- When there are no plates within your cart, you should see a message that says, "Your cart is empty."
- When a plate is added to your cart, the Subtotal and Totals will automatically update.
- When products are in your cart, you should be able to increase and decrease the quantity.
  - A user should not be able to mark the quantity as a negative number.
  - If the quantity goes down to 0, the user will have the option to delete or remove the product for their cart entirely.
- Tax is based on the state of Tennessee sales tax: `0.0975`

Some features from me:

1. Custom scrollBar
2. Button with icon trash when quantity of selected position is 0.
